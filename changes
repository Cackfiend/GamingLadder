This is mainly a bug fix release, so nothing blazing here except for discreet improvement.

// New

- footer shows when the fcron has done something to the ladder to the visitor that triggered it.

- Graphics to the maintenance screen shown to users: Thanks to the wesnoth.org community for it's amazing visuals. Please visit the site and check out the game.


// Fixes 

- Important: The number of games a provisional player has to play before becoming a non-provisional is now correct, corresponding with the settings in the cfg. On LoW this value was 9 due to code error (again), when it was set to 10 in the cfg. The same goes for the games a player needed to play before he gets a ranking at all, it was 8 due to some earlier attempts to mend another bug that was fixed, while it was really set to 10 in cfg.

- Maintenance mode no longer blocks admin from accessing the admin interface.

- Check files for FCron are now in a separate dir for write permission reasons, path is configurable.

- FCronjobs for archieving the ladder day by day had a bug leading to the snapshots not being taken at all some times. 

- Sportsmanship points in games history and also in profile would be too low when doing a foonky db imports where NULL was replaced by 0. 

- Time display error related to UTC on profile & maintenance page.

- On some PHP setups one additional day was somehow added in the buffert days a player has to play a game in to count as active. (Okey, so that's barely readable English...)

- Rerank logs are now gathered in /logs instead of loosely on the server
