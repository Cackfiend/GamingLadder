<h2><b>To do list & future ladder development</b></h2>

<p>This is a list that in no particular order shows what ideas and suggestions by users & admin that are planned and that are <i>likley </i> to get implemented once we find the time to do so properly. Please notice that the list isn't conclusive and that other stuff might be added/deleted/revised without it beeing listed here. If you have suggestions you're welcome to send them to us, but please check to see so that they are not on this list already and read the faq before contacting us. [Name] shows who suggested it.</p>

<b>Primary</b>
<ul>
<li>Save game parser: Will fetch the statistics from the save game and update your profile, showing all kinds of interesting stuff you have no clue about when it comes to your cross- and meta gaming. [eyerouge]</li>
<li>Latest played game replay download: Every player will have his latest game downloadable if he/she chooses so. [several]</li>
<li>Password retrieval: If you forget your password a temp pass will be sent to your account, allowing you to login and change it to something new. [H]</li> 
</ul>

<b>Secondary</b>
<ul>
<li>Player match up / search functions.</li>
<li>RSS support, letting you show various info from our site wherever you want. [eyerouge]</li>
<li>Fancier site layout and more css.</li>

</ul>


<b>Completed</b>
<ul>
<li>Adding server/contact info to the looking for game now-list. [leocrotta]</li>
<li>Export of all ladder members so that they can easily be added to the ingame friendslist, becoming more visible in the lobby, making it easier to find other ladder players. [Doc Paterson]</li>
<li>Contact system, sending swift challange messages from the site to a users email if he/she wishes to be contacted. A challange message will automatically show the person you challange your name, ranking, contact info, when you want to play him etc etc, and it will eliminate the need to go to an email client/site to send a mail manually to the person you want to play. [Meti]</li>
<li>Add better player specific history. [Folket]</li>
<li>Add Jabber/gmail chat field in profile. [H]</li>
</ul>

<b>Ruled out</b>
<p>These are currently ruled out and will most likley be so in the future as well if no new coders want to implement them and it doesnt show we're misstaken.</p>

<ul>
<li>Chat room / shout box: No need, complicates things and will always be empty. However, those who like chat rooms can still start one up for the ladder and/or join the official wesnoth one (recomended and makes more sense) if you prefer to find games that way instead of planning them. [Meti]</li>
</ul>
